## Build

This page is built using ReactJS. It includes conditional JSX rendering.

### Future Development

The next step for this page is to improve the styling from the ground up, most likely employing Materialize to acheive a clean look. After that, it will be important to get the contact form functional on the backend, and improve the UX on it.
